We provide a summary of the main insights of articles and other web content in a short and crisp 100 words or less format we call \u201cideas\u201d.\r\n\r\nEscape the negativity and time wasting pull of social media platforms. Our app\u2019s goal is to help you towards self improvement and self care and to get you motivated, inspired, wiser and productive.\r\n\r\nPersonalized content & feed. Choose a few topics of interest (like self improvement, time management, problem solving, love & relationships & more) and then just use the app at your leisure. As you save ideas and use our app, we learn what you like and find the best stories and articles to show you every day, so you\u2019re motivated and inspired. You don\u2019t even have to work for it.\r\n\r\nThe more you save ideas the better we learn what articles and topics you love. We refresh your recommendations multiple times a day so you never run out of fresh stories and ideas.\r\n\r\nBuild and organize your knowledge. You can save ideas in your own personal profile and build your own hub of facts, skills, quotes, information and ideas that matter to you.\r\n\r\nSearch and filter your ideas and articles by recent, oldest or most popular and organise your knowledge into personalised stashes, which are basically collections of insights stocked up and ready to go for when you need them: a Powerpoint presentation, a new job interview, a date, a project at work, or negotiating your rent with the landlord.\r\n\r\nShare your knowledge. We make it super easy for you to share the best articles, quotes, stories and ideas on any channel you want. Send it to a friend on Whatsapp or share it with your followers on Instagram.\r\n\r\nShare a link to ideas or just an image. We built special image formats for each social network (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and others) so your ideas look best.\r\n\r\nNo ads. No distractions. 100% Free. The Deepstash app is free and open to everyone. Get a clean reading experience and focus on the content instead of being distracted with annoying ads or dozens of notifications about \u201cpremium\u201d subscriptions. Just get a quick free account (Facebook & Google login) and you\u2019re good to go. \r\n\r\nAnd we\u2019ll never sell, lease or share your data. Your privacy is really important to us.\r\n\r\nLearn new things and become a better, smarter you, with the Deepstash app!\r\n\r\nWe're always open to feedback, ideas and thoughts about anything that might make our app the best app it can be.
