When you arrive at a gas station and open BPme, if the app's location on the top of the screen matches the site you are at and is accompanied with a mobile enabled phone icon, then that site is available for BPme use.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to my Driver Rewards balance?\r\n\r\nThe Driver Rewards program ended on 10/1/2019 when we launched a new rewards program called BPme Rewards. When Driver Rewards ended, all outstanding rewards balances expired. If you would like to join BPme Rewards, you will start by saving 5 cents off per gallon on every fuel purchase made through next month.\r\n\r\nWhat payment cards do you accept?\r\n\r\nBPme currently accepts PayPal and all major credit and debit cards including BP credit cards, Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, and Discover. BPme currently does NOT accept fleet cards, gift cards, and pre-paid debit cards.\r\n\r\nWho do I contact if I am having issues with the BPme app?\r\n\r\nIf you are having any issues with either the BPme mobile app or with the BPme Rewards program, please contact our helpdesk at bpconsumer@bp.com or at 1-800-333-3991 for assistance. Additionally, you can provide feedback in the Account section of BPme.\r\n\r\nWhat gas price will I pay if I use a debit card with BPme?\r\n\r\nGas prices are displayed on the entrance to the site and at all of our fuel pumps. When using BPme to purchase fuel (e.g. gas, diesel fuel), you will always be charged the stated credit card price. To receive any exception prices (debit card pricing or discounts for specific credit card brands) that are locally offered by select gas stations, you can use your linked payment card to receive special pricing and qualify for BPme Rewards.\r\n\r\nWhat is the BPme Rewards offer?\r\n\r\nWhen you download BPme and register for BPme Rewards, you will immediately begin to get 5 cents off per gallon on every fuel purchase through the following month. After that, you have the opportunity to keep your 5 cent per gallon reward on all fuel purchases by spending $100 on fuel in a calendar month. Note: BPme Rewards is not valid in California.\r\n\r\nHow do I delete a payment card from my BPme wallet?\r\n\r\nTo remove a payment card from your BPme wallet, go to Account. Tap main payment card, and on the card you'd like to remove, tap the green information \"I\" icon. Tap delete card.\r\n\r\nCan I purchase a car wash using BPme?\r\n\r\nYes. When purchasing fuel, you will have the option to purchase a car wash at gas stations that have a car wash.", "summary": "You can instantly save at Amoco & BP gas stations with the new fuel finder app", "summaryHTML": "You can instantly save at Amoco &amp; BP gas stations with the new fuel finder app", "installs": "500,000+", "minInstalls": 500000, "score": 3.4649806, "ratings": 5172, "reviews": 3304, "histogram": [1489, 281, 342, 452, 2606], "price": 0, "free": true, "currency": "USD", "offersIAP": null, "size": "39M", "androidVersion": "5.0", "androidVersionText": "5.0 and up", "developer": "BP Products North America Inc", "developerId": "BP+Products+North+America+Inc", "developerEmail": "bpconsumer@bp.com", "developerWebsite": "https://www.mybpstation.com/", "developerAddress": null, "privacyPolicy": "https://www.mybpstation.com/privacy-policy", "developerInternalID": "5642618488353251630", "genre": "Travel & Local", "genreId": "TRAVEL_AND_LOCAL", "icon": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Uvmp8BozmRd-Iphr2mPLAXYdsU9M_agwKyX7WxT6kQTGbUyU-rw-U3hN_fIZgyVtOC4", "headerImage": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ED9oBlbS1pxxSHZLl9WEp5zixnwB3g3sOihdPBdxgwLl2XnQPwWVwT7JnhKR8kZ2ew", "screenshots": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0i_r8zfDKmMEtm_JnmVt82WvfOYw9N4LyHf1aRiE6ESGwi_GnbSO_9W2G-dCwGG-O0h0", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3m3SQagReRFadQgVNP9mE9r0CMqRX3hvEnrFKy63WwAcNNBxQuPDexsJqkzbI_Njrg4", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xMlEEvxdMQF5J-C5yDnyfE_YmTOHvMUqi9-7-3jMGfNICYjYsI1LEvOBZjjJ8SmS7Q", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K9CRlB5F0XRzbVpe5-sOC7EPGfExmUPRrFaE5D1dUVjd4XjmaeZoHhuwooBY1UB7XA", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7wQh-hxUFfT1o994_lQbIQKxne7JdmI_2q2_1KJDFeB_iEVB3qzv7Cx9ywQa35mjo2U"], "video": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/uOpQG5f_qNE?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0", "videoImage": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uOpQG5f_qNE/hqdefault.jpg", "contentRating": "Everyone", "contentRatingDescription": null, "adSupported": null, "containsAds": null, "released": "Feb 14, 2018", "updated": 1583330577, "version": "3.22.2", "recentChanges": "This release introduces improvements to make it easier to add payment cards to wallet, navigate the Rewards section, learn more about BPme Rewards and bug fixes", "recentChangesHTML": "This release introduces improvements to make it easier to add payment cards to wallet, navigate the Rewards section, learn more about BPme Rewards and bug fixes", "error": false}, "average_cvss": 6.3, "security_score": 0}
