We give you free, state-specific DMV practice tests that are the same as the real thing.\r\n\r\nHOW IT WORKS\r\n\u2022 No Need for the Driver's Manual:  We provide you with the most up-to-date questions based on the current version of your state's official driver's handbook.  Don't be surprised with outdated test questions. We cover every DMV, DDS, BMV, MVA, RMV, DOR, MVC, MVD, DOT, DOL in the country.\r\n\u2022 Take Comprehensive Practice Tests:  Our tests cover every section of the driver's manual so no matter what state you're in, you'll be well prepared.  Go through our practice tests and when you take the real thing, it will seem easy.\r\n\u2022 Pass the DMV Test:  Once you've practiced enough and are passing the practice exams, you should be ready to make an appointment with the DMV.  With a 99% chance of passing, you'll be ready to pass the test the first time!\r\n\r\nPRACTICE DMV TESTS MAKE YOU PASS FASTER\r\nA whopping 5 out of 10 people fail the DMV test the first time they take it, but the people that use DMV WRITTEN TEST see a 99% pass rate.  We also let you take every sample DMV permit test and DMV license test for free as many times as needed so you can be sure you're ready for the real thing.\r\n\r\nWHY CHOOSE DMV WRITTEN TEST?\r\n\u2022 State-Specific Tests:  Because each state has different driving laws and restrictions, we've tailored our tests to each specific state.  This isn't one of those generic DMV practice tests.  \r\n\u2022 Accurate & Up-to-Date:  We constantly monitor the newest versions of your state's official driving handbook and traffic laws and then update our test questions accordingly.  They are always accurate and up to date.\r\n\u2022 The Same Content:  Since we take our facts directly from the handbooks, it allows us to create practice test questions that are very similar, if not identical, to the questions found on the actual driver's license test.\r\n\r\nWHY WE\u2019RE SO EFFECTIVE\r\n\u2022 Know what to expect:  Our tests have the same number of questions and the same passing score requirements as the actual tests so you'll know what to expect.\r\n\u2022 Feel confident as you walk into the DMV:  You've seen it all before and know what's coming.  You got this!\r\n\u2022 Stay motivated to study:  With our practice tests you'll learn as you go and see your own progress in real time.\r\n\r\nHAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?\r\nIf you have any questions, want to report a bug, or notice any errors, feel free to reach out to us.", "summary": "Free Practice Driving Tests for Cars, CDL, and Motorcycles. 99% Pass Rate.", "summaryHTML": "Free Practice Driving Tests for Cars, CDL, and Motorcycles. 99% Pass Rate.", "installs": "5,000+", "minInstalls": 5000, "score": 4.7798166, "ratings": 109, "reviews": 52, "histogram": [1, 1, 2, 13, 92], "price": 0, "free": true, "currency": "USD", "offersIAP": null, "size": "17M", "androidVersion": "4.4W", "androidVersionText": "4.4W and up", "developer": "DMV Written Test", "developerId": "DMV+Written+Test", "developerEmail": "dmvwrittentest@gmail.com", "developerWebsite": "http://dmv-written-test.com", "developerAddress": null, "privacyPolicy": "https://www.dmv-written-test.com/privacypolicy.html", "developerInternalID": "6874861573178800168", "genre": "Education", "genreId": "EDUCATION", "icon": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H-7lySGOizgS-isn0BMWnY_fpRKVvbgwIsBHo75I82pYBTef0kMSpgc85KzsbXYEbQ5v", "headerImage": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/R03YPHo1Bo_AWlvfpNxHIOcofZJc0u3mDRL63-dGQz8vXs57vsDU918tKcNb3waDtjo", "screenshots": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pS_ozFvoR8ceLkWURxjyAQVz1lBkxKcVeN64J8g4lS1yvssMJM1PWSm982r1DutMV1k", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Hs-n8k1t3FetYAMS-PMKBYv6L6ZC-tKIKnAs8tS_Voy3lOigU5MXniKMLcVRJ9anDH9U", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7ijhUQ0lMbbFfLg0KPFwEjX87_epj5nKKh2SWT5di_Qb_fcL_WMMsAAPaOuu8_3H3w", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b4DGnPKNbX5fYZG_9uf6BkoXnGrt-Nu1g-gpj51Wa04fx4EG0CwXXuOOAzfbCDZYa0Wp", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5EAU7iG1G1pYdQ2NW9xY70aYvaGprog4-fqZz6ilkmHczO0-UmyOEdq3qhh60WMnVS4", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ww5qYLZqKJHOUtYFrt7cJSwv8iEOzCS8v3qKgz1RJ7IDApJw2BTcuLqF-bgAHe1KjMmc", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6pMeLoltKgQ2LtDFrDtLj35e_Z4hjbpHJV4Uwf7XINn58CEg9LStNy-5-gK7P8HBMw", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UyxToCbeunxRBDi4lgc0X-r55C4UiP2mWEa4HmHYQF_6tq12BwAo8VP3E-6GHjzAxHU", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xxkmhP0K-LMOI9hrMN6RBqV46YUzkbLt7tCvArOKWaHiXLd2-Vxry7aLieyq7FWstSk", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MGH4mEsUUcDrIsx0tBYS-xLuMuQGoNgbyWUSFORpfTm1FCp7Rv2X0-JrW2rRSWBvNh35", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HQcVDO-baZnO3zFYT1h4Ns__4QqfZkMyOcZwWr64dNWvZe0ae0rM2N1uCztVv7Sxxw", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ES6Bm93sHoFFRKCSj_7yCwcNAbEowKPYSpryGhpCJjkgEsAGg8CVxfsT-kE1UFZHme4"], "video": null, "videoImage": null, "contentRating": "Everyone", "contentRatingDescription": null, "adSupported": true, "containsAds": true, "released": "Feb 2, 2020", "updated": 1583190873, "version": "1.1.9", "recentChanges": "Fixed some bugs", "recentChangesHTML": "Fixed some bugs", "error": false}, "average_cvss": 5.8, "security_score": 65}
