This app lists all breeds according to the international definition of the FCI as well as some more. Futhermore, you can use the Dog Scanner app to vote for even more (unofficial) dog breeds to be supported soon.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\nThis app cannot transform your smartphone into a crazy space ship being able to extract the blood of your dog with a magic laser. The app gives educated predictions based on what it sees. On average, those predictions are quite accurate. However, it\u2018s obvious that the result can only be as good as the image/video you provide to the app. Furthermore, it\u2018s impossible to get each and every individual dog detected correctly. People tend to take it personal, if their own beloved dog isn\u2018t predicted right though. If you give the app a chance in the first place, you\u2018ll see that its overall performance is pretty decent. Instead of having to pay a lot of money for a DNA test, you\u2018re getting this app for free. Enjoy!", "summary": "See a dog, but don't know its breed?
