You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester\u2019s language course you could barely say \u201cHello!\u201d to a foreigner. Mondly\u2019s approach is different from the average language course.\r\n\r\nThe future of language courses\r\nThe app gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end you will reconstruct the conversation with your voice. Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.\r\n\r\nThe key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:\n\u2713 Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors. \r\n\r\n\u00bb Learn pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.\r\n\r\n\u2713 State-of-the-art Speech Recognition. \r\n\r\n\u00bb Mondly listens as you pronounce words and phrases. You will get positive feedback if you speak clearly and correctly.\r\n\r\n\u2713 Useful phrases for real situations. \r\n\r\n\u00bb Memorizing isolated words is not the way to learn a language. Mondly teaches you vocabulary through core words and phrases.
