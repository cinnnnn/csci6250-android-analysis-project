Pre-installed by the phone manufacturer, this service allows you to connect ANT+ devices to apps on your phone.  ANT Wireless is a division of Garmin Canada Inc.\r\n\r\nANT enabled apps can utilize this service to connect:\r\n\u2022 Heart Rate: Receive live heart rate data from heart rate straps or wearables produced by many popular manufacturers\r\n\u2022 Fitness Equipment: Connect ANT+ enabled fitness equipment and bicycle trainers to  popular training and workout apps\r\n\u2022 Bike Speed and Cadence: Capture bike speed, distance, and/or cadence data\r\n\u2022 Bike Power: Capture data from ANT+ cycling power meters such as Garmin Vector  \r\n\u2022 Stride-based Speed and Distance Monitor: Capture speed and distance data from running footpods\r\n\r\nFor a full list of compatible ANT+ apps and devices visit https://www.thisisant.com/directory/\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\nHow did this app get on my phone and is it spyware? \r\nThis service is standard software, included by the manufacturer of your phone. It is not illegally downloaded, and it is not spyware. It will not cause system malfunctions or pop-up ads to appear. It is not bloatware and typically uses a max of 20 MB of space. For example, on a 16GB phone, this service takes up 0.0013% of space. We do not pay phone manufacturers to have this service pre-installed. \r\n\r\nHow can I remove this service? \r\nSince this service is standard software, you\u2019re unable to delete it from your phone. Instead, you can disable this service by following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The typical process is: settings>applications>application manager>appropriate app>force stop>disable\r\n\r\nDisabling this service will not affect your phone\u2019s software. If, in the future, you require the ability to connect to services and devices via ANT+, just enable the service again. \r\n\r\nNOTE: Since this is a factory installed service, it may enable/re-download if you reset and/or update your phone. Don\u2019t panic! Just follow the instructions to disable it again. \r\n\r\nDoes this service track me without my knowledge?\r\nNo. The ANT Radio Service and ANT+ Plugins Service applications provide a wireless connectivity service, similar to Bluetooth or WiFi, but with very low power. These services do not collect any personal data.\r\n\r\nIs it difficult to develop an app with ANT+ capabilities and is there a fee? \r\nUsing the ANT+ plugins in your app to communicate with ANT+ devices is quick, easy, free and uses a simple API. Visit the ANT Android Developer page (http://www.thisisant.com/developer/ant/ant-in-android) for more information and to download the SDK. \r\n\r\nHow do I know if I own any ANT enabled products? \r\nVisit https://www.thisisant.com/directory to search for ANT/ANT+ enabled products, devices and/or services.", "summary": "Enables ANT and ANT+ wireless technology in your phone or using an ANT USB stick", "summaryHTML": "Enables ANT and ANT+ wireless technology in your phone or using an ANT USB stick", "installs": "1,000,000,000+", "minInstalls": 1000000000, "score": 3.9573631, "ratings": 201310, "reviews": 47587, "histogram": [35439, 7628, 13531, 18186, 126524], "price": 0, "free": true, "currency": "USD", "offersIAP": null, "size": "185k", "androidVersion": "2.1", "androidVersionText": "2.1 and up", "developer": "ANT+", "developerId": "ANT%2B", "developerEmail": "android@thisisant.com", "developerWebsite": "http://www.thisisant.com/consumer/", "developerAddress": null, "privacyPolicy": null, "developerInternalID": "7167427154189235234", "genre": "Communication", "genreId": "COMMUNICATION", "icon": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tcREqZGBts5gQL_L8uXdk80YnCkOrVFmFFLNfjqb6VpvYEDd-KkJprvkkqnWa4Y9tQ", "headerImage": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8S4eW1LvPd2DUEx0pagGgPfGqZwqpkJ06VSm6wsU3tLC4GZYPokj05s_-C2yCCYJjc4", "screenshots": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NXYFvip3lPodD8BWbFLgzm2mxeZZuVGmg1J1d0uCcpctGTcm4RPYYHqZU-gRbdScJzg", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/95RPQY_8o--yj0-cnoLKeU0FvSTyP0qU4UkP56jnKU4g3lP-zkh3uaKt7ui4W0LztA", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i2wEsIqkFYT51K0YX_n96GGw1p9V1_N-8paKqe4rg5cvnZ9MhhDtVKyf8nz0T9btzHE", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0bkYBTiwbvzKVv8DNJuj7RE69Jm7J5Ycqh9EqaF3URBmMfSFfmPY-0_SbbDsaOJ1zw0", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ys5l2biYosSYHOrGfSlTTLupG88A9SqD8DzAu0F7QwjTyFBe0QyERD0br3zpwlvRNg"], "video": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/2nDCi_euFzg?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0", "videoImage": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2nDCi_euFzg/hqdefault.jpg", "contentRating": "Everyone", "contentRatingDescription": null, "adSupported": null, "containsAds": null, "released": "Nov 5, 2010", "updated": 1541024143, "version": "4.15.00", "recentChanges": "Note: This service may be pre-installed by your device manufacturer to allow the ANT wireless hardware already present in your mobile device to operate.
