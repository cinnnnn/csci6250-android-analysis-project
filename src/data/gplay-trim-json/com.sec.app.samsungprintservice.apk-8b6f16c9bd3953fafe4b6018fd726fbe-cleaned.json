Nearly all new printers sold today by Brother, Canon, Dell, Epson, Fuji Xerox, HP, Konica Minolta, Kyocera, Lexmark, Pantum, Ricoh, Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba and Xerox are Mopria-certified to make it easy to print your photos, web pages, documents, coupons, recipes and files from your favorite apps. You can even control print settings including color, number of copies, paper orientation and double-sided printing.\r\n\r\nIf you own a Samsung Galaxy phone, this system tool is already pre-installed. For any Android phone or tablet running KitKat (4.4) or higher, installing this plug-in will enable easy mobile printing from your device.\r\n\r\nPHONE AND TABLET COMPATIBILITY\r\nSamsung Galaxy Phones/Tablets \u2013 The Samsung Print Service plug-in is pre-installed on S4, S5, S6, S7 and many other Samsung  phones & tablets. This plug-in cannot be uninstalled or moved to a SD card. When plug-in updates are available your device will notify you. Please adjust your settings to automatically update this plug\u2010in, or accept updates manually. For any other Galaxy phone or tablet where this Plug-in is not pre-installed, it can be downloaded and installed as long as the Samsung device is running Android KitKat (4.4) or later.\r\n\r\nOther Android Phones/Tablets \u2013 The Samsung Print Service will work with any device with Android KitKat (4.4) or later. KitKat was the first version of Android that included the \u201cAndroid Print Framework\u201d which allows an Android App to access a built-in printing system. When updates are available for the Samsung Print Service, your device will notify you.\r\n\r\nAPPS SUPPORTING PRINT\r\nCheck to see if your Android App supports printing by looking for a print icon, checking the App\u2019s menu option (three dots, three lines or \u201cMore\u201d menu) or using the \u201cShare\u201d function.\r\nSome everyday apps that support printing include Gallery, Photos, Chrome, Gmail, Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Adobe Reader, Microsoft Excel, Word and PowerPoint.\r\nMany more apps have enabled print or allow you to share to the Samsung Print Service.\r\n\r\nTURNING ON THE SAMSUNG PRINT SERVICE\r\nIf you are unable to locate any printers, you may need to enable the Samsung Print Service.\r\nGo to your device \u201cSettings\u201d and search for \u201cPrinting\u201d to locate the Samsung Print Service. Then toggle the switch from \u201cOff\u201d to \u201cOn\u201d.\r\n\r\nSUPPORTED PRINTERS\r\nBrother, Canon, Dell, Epson, Fuji Xerox, HP, Konica Minolta, Kyocera, Lexmark, Pantum, Ricoh, Sharp, Toshiba and Xerox branded printers are supported. However not all models are Mopria-certified.\r\nSee http://mopria.org/certified-products to check whether your printer model is supported.\r\n\r\nSamsung Printers\r\nM2020/2070/283x/288x/262x/282x/267x/287x/4370/5370/4580/5270/4530/403x/408x/\r\n301x/306x/5360 Series\r\nC410/460/420/470/430/480/1810/1860/2620/2670/268x/140x/145x/4820/3010/3060/3\r\n51x/401x/406x Series\r\nCLP-300/31x/32x/350/360/610/620/660/670/680/770/775 Series\r\nCLX-216x/316x/317x/318x/838x/854x/9252/9352/92x1/93x1 Series\r\nML-1865W/2150/2160/2165/2250/2525/257x/2580/285x/2950/305x/3300/347x/331x/37\r\n1x/405x/455x/551x/651x Series\r\nSCX-1490/2000/320x/340x/4623/4x21/4x24/4x26/4x28/470x/472x/4x33/5x35/5x37/65\r\n45/6555/8030/8040/8123/8128 Series\r\nSF-650, SF-760 Series\r\nSL-J1760/2920/2960/3520/3560/5520/5560 Series", "summary": "Print from your favorite apps to any printer brand.", "summaryHTML": "Print from your favorite apps to any printer brand.", "installs": "1,000,000,000+", "minInstalls": 1000000000, "score": 4.2870655, "ratings": 354226, "reviews": 67148, "histogram": [37444, 9831, 20709, 31849, 254391], "price": 0, "free": true, "currency": "USD", "offersIAP": null, "size": "Varies with device", "androidVersion": "4.4", "androidVersionText": "4.4 and up", "developer": "HP Inc.", "developerId": "9030305074573031837", "developerEmail": "support@samsungcloudprint.com", "developerWebsite": "https://www.samsung.com/us/printer/", "developerAddress": "Attn: HP Inc.
