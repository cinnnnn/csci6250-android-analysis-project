Web Video Cast\u2122 does not perform any video/audio decoding or transcoding. \r\n\r\nGET STARTED\nFollow these simple step-by-step instructions to start streaming:\r\n1.- Browse the web or the local file explorer to find the video, audio or photo you want to cast to your tv. \r\n2.- If the video or audio is on a website, try to play the video inside the web page. If it is a photo, you can long press on it to cast it. \r\n3.- Connect to your streaming device to cast the video, music, or picture. \r\n\r\nPREMIUM FEATURES**\r\n\u2022 No in-app advertising. \r\n\u2022 Bookmarks. \r\n\u2022 Home page setting. \r\n\u2022 Video history. \r\n\u2022 Queue. \r\n\u2022 Homescreen shortcut. \r\n\u2022 Most visited site. \r\n\r\n**This functionality does not apply universally to all streaming devices.  \r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS & DISCLOSURES\r\nAs with all apps, there are some limitations we are aware of and want you to know about up front. \r\n\r\n\u2022 We are in no way associated with any web media providers and we do not have control over the content they provide. \r\n\u2022 The app does not support tab casting, like the Chromecast extension for the PC web browser. \r\n\u2022 We cannot do anything to fix issues that arise on the server side (media content provider) such as failure to play or buffering, which is especially common during heavy load times and weekends. \r\n\u2022 Refunds are only issued within 24 hours of purchase and you must submit the order number in text, not a screenshot. \r\n\r\nSHARE YOUR FEEDBACK\r\nWe are committed to open communication with our users. Please contact us first with any questions or support issues before leaving a review. We will respond and address your concerns promptly.
