We\u2019re used by over 250 million gamers around the world.\r\n\r\nCreate secure chat channels to play games with friends, organize squads, find teammates, LFG, and participate in gaming communities. Whether you play Battle Royale or MOBA, FPS or RPG, or if you follow streamers or esports, you can easily start a group chat for everything you and your gaming clan want to talk about.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s why Discord is the best gaming chat app ever:\r\n\r\n* Live text, voice, and video chat\r\n\r\nMessage, call, and chat with your friends in real-time for all your gaming needs: everything from coordinating play sessions for Apex Legends to discussing League of Legends game meta, and organizing CS:GO team events to meming about Hearthstone. You can even upload your own images and GIFs.\r\n\r\n* Private and public messaging\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re making a chat server for your personal Fortnite squad or a big online Dota 2 coaching community, Discord\u2019s got you covered. DM friends 1-on-1, group chat in a secret invite-only clan, or even start a public channel that anyone can join. You can participate in as many servers as you like!\r\n\r\n* Instant invite links for chat servers\r\n\r\nInviting friends to talk is as simple as copy/pasting a link. Once your teammates open your unique server link, they\u2019ll instantly be added to your voice or text chat group so you can immediately start playing games, organizing World of Warcraft raids, and trash talking your Rocket League buddies.\r\n\r\n* Server tools and member roles\r\n\r\nDiscord is full of tools to help you organize your guilds however you like. Tidy up conversations by adding topic-based channels within each server, and assign roles to members if you want to give them special permissions or mod powers. You can also sort specific clan members into groups that you can message all at once with a single tag.\r\n\r\n* Community management\r\n\r\nGroups of all sizes thrive on Discord. In fact, we\u2019re the preferred communication app of game developers, Reddit communities, Twitch streamers, YouTube content creators, and countless other gaming-related interest groups to post news, polls, giveaways, and discussion topics for their thousands of followers.\r\n\r\n* Push notification controls\r\n\r\nWant to be notified when someone DMs or tags you to play Overwatch, but not when there\u2019s a big debate about theorycrafting in your MTG Arena group? That\u2019s easy with our detailed server notification settings, which give you complete control over what types of messages you get alerted for.\r\n\r\n* Cross-platform app for AFK chatting\r\n\r\nDiscord is available for both mobile and desktop so you can voice chat with your team while playing games like PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, or Destiny 2 on your PC, and continue to meme with the whole squad on your phone when you\u2019re out playing Pokemon Go. Have all the flexibility you need in an app that\u2019s fun, sleek, and easy to use.\r\n\r\nMillions of Discord servers have been created so far, with rich communities and tight-knit guilds formed around numerous games and interests. So what are you waiting for? Install Discord for free, start a chat server or join a friend\u2019s, and make yourself at home.\r\n\r\nHave questions or feedback?
