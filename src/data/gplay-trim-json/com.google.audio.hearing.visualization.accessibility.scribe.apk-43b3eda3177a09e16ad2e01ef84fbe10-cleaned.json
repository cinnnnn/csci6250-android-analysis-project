Using Google's state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition technology, Live Transcribe performs real-time transcription of speech and sound to text on your screen, so you can more easily participate in conversations going on in the world around you. You can also keep the conversation going by typing your response on the screen.\r\n\r\nOn Pixel 3 and up, these additional steps are required to use Live Transcribe:\r\n1. Open your device's Settings app.\r\n2. Tap \"Accessibility\", then tap \"Live Transcribe\".\r\n3. Tap \"Use service\", then accept the permissions.\r\n4. An Accessibility button should now appear at the bottom right corner of your screen, next to the Home button. Tap the Accessibility button or use gesture (https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/7650693) to start Live Transcribe.\r\n\r\nReal-time transcription:\r\n\u2022 Supports transcription in over 70 languages and dialects.\r\n\u2022 Supports quick-switching between 2 languages.\r\n\u2022 Displays non-speech sound so that you know if someone is knocking on your door or a dog is barking.\r\n\u2022 Reply without speaking by typing your responses within the app.\r\n\r\nReferring back to transcription:\r\n\u2022 You can save a transcript up to 3 days which stays secure on your device. (By default, transcriptions are not saved.)\r\n\u2022 Touch and hold the transcript to copy & paste.\r\n\r\nFor more accurate transcription:\r\n\u2022 Use an external microphones found in wired headsets, Bluetooth headsets, and USB mics for better audio reception.\r\n\u2022 Check the loudness and noise indicator to find out if your environment is suitable for transcription.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\u2022 Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and up.\r\n\r\nLive Transcribe was made in collaboration with Gallaudet University, the premier Deaf and hard of hearing university in the US.\r\n\r\nJoin the Google Accessible community (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/accessible) to provide feedback and receive product updates.Visit link: http://g.co/disabilitysupport to connect with an expert on the Disability Support team.\r\n\r\nPermissions Notice\nMicrophone: Live Transcribe needs microphone access to transcribe the speech around you.
