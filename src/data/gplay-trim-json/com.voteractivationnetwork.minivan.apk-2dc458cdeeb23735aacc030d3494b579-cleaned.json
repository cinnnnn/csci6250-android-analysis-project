The miniVAN system allows users to export canvassing lists from VAN onto an iOS or Android device.  Canvassers can then enter data into their device as they talk to people on their list.  When the canvassers connect their device to the Internet over a wireless or cellular network, they can upload their data back to the VAN with the touch of a button.  Administrative users on the VAN can then review the data and apply it to the database in one quick step. \r\n\r\nCanvassing with miniVAN allows NGP VAN clients to spend more time and resources on actually contacting people instead of on data entry.
