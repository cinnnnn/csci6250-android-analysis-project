Whether you\u2019re a professional musician, or just a beginner starting to learn how to play a new instrument, DaTuner is the best option for you!\r\n\r\nDaTuner's display is easy to read\r\nNearest note and octave is displayed in a giant, easy to read font, and frequency in hertz plus error in cents is displayed at the bottom of the screen. Sensitivity is auto-adjusted, but can also be adjusted by touch via a bar on the left-hand side of the screen, and the speed/accuracy of the algorithm and the relative frequency can be adjusted via the configuration menu.\r\n\r\nNo Dead Zone\r\nThere is no \"dead zone\" with this tuner app as is the case with many other apps. Instead, the whole display turns green when the incoming frequency is within a configurable range of the target frequency and you can still see changes in pitch even the \"in-range\" area. Both the \"in-tune\" range and the colours shown for sharp and flat can be configured.\r\n\r\nNot worth five stars? Please ensure to leave a comment with your rating so we can fix it!
