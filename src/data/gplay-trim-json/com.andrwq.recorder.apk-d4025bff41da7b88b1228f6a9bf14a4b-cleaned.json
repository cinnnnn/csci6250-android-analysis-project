It has been specifically designed for high-quality and long-time recording with a clean and simple user interface.\r\n\r\nWith a skipping silence on-the-fly feature you can shorten recordings by omitting relative silence. It allows you, for example, to catch night sleep talks or maybe some snoring, whatever comes first. \ud83d\ude34 It is by the way how the idea to make this app was born: my wife wanted to prove that I talk at night. It turns out, I do. \ud83e\udd14\r\n\r\nSince 2012 this app has been installed on more than 40 million devices worldwide and proven to be a reliable everyday tool. From it's early days it has been known as Smart Voice Recorder, rebranded later to a bit more generic name. Because, you know, it's great not only for voice. \ud83c\udfb8\r\n\r\nRegarding phone calls: \ud83d\udcf2\r\nThis app is not designed explicitly for recording phone calls. Some manufacturers block the ability to record the other party of a phone call for privacy or legal reasons. For the same purpose, the app will even pause the recording during phone calls, but it can be turned off in the settings. Check your local laws and make sure it works on your handset first.\r\n\r\nMore features:\r\n\u2022  Automatic and manual sensitivity control for Skip silence mode (Beta)\r\n\u2022  Live audio spectrum analyzer\r\n\u2022  Wave/PCM encoding with adjustable sample rate (8-44 kHz)\r\n\u2022  Recording in the background (even when a display is off)\r\n\u2022  Save/pause/resume/cancel recording process control\r\n\u2022  Efficient and easy on battery\r\n\u2022  Recording time limited only by available space on your storage (and tech. limit 2GB per file)\r\n\u2022  Straightforward recordings list and many sharing options\r\n\u2022  Launcher shortcut to start recording in one tap\r\n\u2022  Microphone gain calibration tool.", "summary": "Easy to use audio recorder \u2022 Skip silence \u2022 Sound quality \u2022 Smart Voice Recorder", "summaryHTML": "Easy to use audio recorder \u2022 Skip silence \u2022 Sound quality \u2022 Smart Voice Recorder", "installs": "10,000,000+", "minInstalls": 10000000, "score": 4.663834, "ratings": 445457, "reviews": 128897, "histogram": [11084, 4068, 12122, 68959, 349222], "price": 0, "free": true, "currency": "USD", "offersIAP": true, "size": "Varies with device", "androidVersion": "Varies", "androidVersionText": "Varies with device", "developer": "SmartMob", "developerId": "SmartMob", "developerEmail": "contact@smartmob.dev", "developerWebsite": "https://help.smartmob.dev", "developerAddress": "1037 NE 65th St #80412\nSeattle, WA  98115", "privacyPolicy": "https://help.smartmob.dev/article/111-privacy-policy", "developerInternalID": "4950146786157653746", "genre": "Music & Audio", "genreId": "MUSIC_AND_AUDIO", "icon": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XQLj9_alga8LhhfCPTMSNJulR2aIBPc6GxdA-yTnUsjN87IglbqVMbWyqOmQ-O7GAV4", "headerImage": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cgIlSsKJ-1IGYDTicOUa6sHwJ7LTLSeemPoEef-ewmgm78Q73WDCTTuYtd_hGBbaopU", "screenshots": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rB5u_ovX7htTpDBvlYrPRDViWGq73F56nHikInuJlSLyNVmDzMpyNgY5Km0HXqPKD6I", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zNSFyUtGly6m_XDZU87RH1KSrnhICrOSspclNSi7C3ZsVUqAiQwWotSjKDDOO3tzaw", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TmmbhxbQhZSASLvmdJVmpqs_sBhDFfasuE4nOEqS3pCY5lDexzeuxdUcvBeKbfvuOF8", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nUZMaw0YjssLjWPKVekROy_A3nkF3ZSx6FYUrGUALU7DnIjJoOJFd5OWJOoa7FO6vT3s", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O9nnypjtNV6RrN0WmXFSXBsBgX32gATUez1zoHyHDFc1fAAFK8dWpGjFiVVALh1oZMJT", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N5ehlji7pGeBAyIiI6a9UNsFAuxfdeUSSBUqV_ClhUeMRxgX_kavFVJsjsIX2-wwdWo", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/386aEbhQoU-9mo066U9ybabuDunPRw-ltY5qsuZhFEqqjTw_2QjIVkqVTEtdoR3QMx8"], "video": null, "videoImage": null, "contentRating": "Everyone", "contentRatingDescription": null, "adSupported": true, "containsAds": true, "released": "May 19, 2012", "updated": 1580238686, "version": "Varies with device", "recentChanges": "Under the hood improvements release: playback stability, background playback and some fixes here and there.", "recentChangesHTML": "Under the hood improvements release: playback stability, background playback and some fixes here and there.", "error": false}, "average_cvss": 5.7, "security_score": 45}
