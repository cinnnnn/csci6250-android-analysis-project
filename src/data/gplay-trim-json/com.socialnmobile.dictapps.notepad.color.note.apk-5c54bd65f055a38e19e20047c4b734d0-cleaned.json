Taking notes with ColorNote\u00ae Notepad is easier than any other notepad or memo pad app.\r\n\r\n* Notice *\r\n- If you cannot find the widget, then please read the FAQ below.\r\n- When you're finished using the notepad, an automatic save command preserves your individual note.\r\n\r\n* Product Description *\r\nColorNote\u00ae features two basic note taking formats, a lined-paper styled text option, and a checklist option. Add as many as you want to your master list, which appears on the app's home screen each time the program opens. This list may be viewed in traditional ascending order, in grid format, or by note color.\r\n\r\n- Taking a Note -\r\nServing as a simple word processing program, the text option allows for as many characters as you're willing to type. Once saved, you can edit, share, set a reminder, or check off or delete the note through your device's menu button. When checking off a text note, the app places a slash through the list's title, and this will be displayed on the main menu.\r\n\r\n- Making To-do List or Shopping List -\r\nIn the checklist mode, you can add as many items as you'd like and arrange their order with drag buttons activated in the edit mode. After the list is finished and saved, you may check or uncheck each line on your list with a quick tap, which will toggle a line slash. If all items have been checked, then the list's title is slashed as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Features *\r\n- Organize notes by color (color notebook)\r\n- Sticky note memo widget (Put your notes on your home screen)\r\n- Checklist notes for To do list & Shopping list.
