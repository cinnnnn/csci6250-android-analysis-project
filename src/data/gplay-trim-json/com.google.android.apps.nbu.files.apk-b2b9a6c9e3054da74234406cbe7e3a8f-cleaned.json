View, delete, move, rename or share any files. Sort them by file size to understand what\u2019s taking space. Browse all the GIFs your have. Find and share that video you downloaded last week. All of this with few taps.\r\n\r\nSHARE FILES OFFLINE\r\nShare your pictures, videos, documents, or apps with others nearby who also have the app. With fast speed up to 480 Mbps, it\u2019s fast, free, and it works without the internet, so it doesn\u2019t cost mobile data. Just pair up your phone with anyone nearby who has Files app.\r\n\r\nENCRYPTED FILE SHARING\r\nFiles\u2019s offline file sharing is secured with WPA2 encryption, providing a more secure file transfer. Files app uses Bluetooth to set up encrypted and direct fast wifi connection, so that you can transfer app APK or large files in seconds, send videos or pictures to your friends. Safe and secure.\r\n\r\nBACKUP FILES TO THE CLOUD\r\nIf you want to keep a file forever, select it from the Files menu and back it up to Google Drive or any other cloud storage app. Save them forever without taking space in your phone.\r\n\r\nBACKUP FILES TO THE SD CARD\r\nIf you run out of storage on your phone, simply transfer large files or videos to your SD card if you have one. With a few clicks, you can clean up your phone and fully use the SD card. That leaves your internal storage free and your phone faster.\r\n\r\nEFFICIENT, EFFECTIVE STORAGE MANAGEMENT\r\nFiles app takes less than 10MB of storage on your phone.
